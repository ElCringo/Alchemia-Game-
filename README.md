# Alchemia-Game-
This is a WIP.
Alchemia is a browser-based crafting game where players embody alchemists attempting to achieve Magnum Opus (Philosopher's Stone) through experimentation. The gameplay revolves around selecting magical ingredients, processing them with arcane methods,(while using alchemical tools), and observing the reactions that unfold. Player's must be careful though, in choosing the ingredients and methods to interact with them, as the outcomes of the alchemical reactions can be extremely volatile!
